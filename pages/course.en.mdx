# Prompt Engineering Course

Due to high demand, we've partnered with Maven to deliver a new [cohort-based course on Prompt Engineering for LLMs](https://maven.com/dair-ai/prompt-engineering-llms).

[Elvis Saravia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omarsar/), who has worked at companies like Meta AI and Elastic, and has years of experience in AI and LLMs, will be the instructor for this course.

This hands-on course will cover prompt engineering techniques/tools, use cases, exercises, and projects for effectively working and building with large language models (LLMs).

Our past learners range from software engineers to AI researchers and practitioners in organizations like LinkedIn, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Intuit, Fidelity Investments, Coinbase, Guru, and many others.
